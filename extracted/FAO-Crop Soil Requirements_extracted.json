        "All agronomic data on crop responses to nutrients should always be subjected to economic analysis to account for differences in input and output prices and to address the basic issue of whether and to what extent fertilizer application will be profitable.",
        "Information on factors affecting returns from nutrient application is valuable in decision-making.",
        "Principal elements of production economics for fertilizer use include: physical yield response to applied fertilizers; price of fertilizer and crop (including transport, handling, marketing costs, and cost of servicing a loan); and the individual farmer's decision-making and risk-taking ability.",
        "Important economic and institutional factors influencing fertilizer use include: the price relationship between fertilizers and the crops to which they are applied, together with the market outlook for these crops; the farmer's financial resources along with the availability and cost of credit; conditions of land tenure; and adequate supplies and distribution facilities.",
        "Government policies, financing facilities, and marketing systems can positively or negatively influence these factors.",
        "Farmers will apply plant nutrients only where their beneficial effects on crop yields are profitable.",
        "Farmers' pursuit of higher income through higher yield should be balanced against the need to maintain soil fertility and avoid soil degradation.",
        "The profitability of adopting Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) should be viewed over a longer term, as improvements in soil conditions associated with superior Nutrient Use Efficiency (NUE) tend to become apparent only after several cropping seasons.",
        "Improved access to plant nutrient sources, markets, and low-risk production technology, coupled with the removal of financial and operational constraints (such as recycling of rainwater), will allow farmers to adopt plant nutrient management practices that are economically attractive and can support long-term sustainable crop production.",
        "In drought years, no fertilizer should be applied.",
        "In years with above average rainfall, even the normal rate of application would be insufficient for maximum yields.",
        "The basic requirement of profitable crop production is to produce an agronomic yield that can maximize net returns.",
        "Even the highest yield would not be of interest if its production were not cost-effective.",
        "Farmers should realize that top profits are possible only with optimal investment, correct decisions and favourable weather."
